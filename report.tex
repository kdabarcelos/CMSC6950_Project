\section{Introduction}

Tidynamics \cite{Buyl2018} calculates mean-square displacements (MSD) of a trajectory and correlation functions of input data using the Fast Correlation Algorithm. \cite{kneller1995nmoldyn} This package is beneficial for quantitatively evaluating dynamics of stochastic and molecular simulations from numerical trajectories. The autocorrelation function is a correlation of a variable with itself between two successive time intervals (time lags), while mean-square displacement is a deviation of the position of a certain particle regarding a reference position at time intervals. Both funtions are defined by the respective relations below in tidynamics, where the angle brackets denote an average over time. \cite{kneller1995nmoldyn}

The data format input and output of tidynamics \cite{Buyl2018} is array, simply depending only on Python and NumPy. The NumPy arrays where the first index indicates the timestep and the second index, in case of correlation function between two time-series, shows the spatial coordinates of the trajectory. Both ACF and MSD are defined by the respective equations below in tidynamics algorithm \cite{Buyl2018}, where the angle brackets denote an average over time. \cite{kneller1995nmoldyn}

\begin{equation}
C_{AB}(\tau) = \langle A(0) B(\tau) \rangle,
\label{correlation}
\end{equation}
where  $A(0)$ and $B(\tau)$ represent the input data quantity A and the quantity at some later time B, respectively.

\begin{equation}
MSD(\tau) = \langle (x(\tau) - x(0) )^2 \rangle,
\label{msd}
\end{equation}
where $x(\tau)$ and $x(0)$ refer to current and reference positions, respectively.

The aim of this project was to implement two computational tasks of dynamical systems from a chosen open source package such as tidynamics\cite{Buyl2018}. For the first task, the autocorrelation funtion was computed for the bond length of C-H and C=O over 700 ns of a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation from a certain Tyrosine amino acid. For the second task,a random walk values and its mean-square displacement were generated. Several modules were utilized during the project, including, numpy, pandas, math, sys, and matplotlib.
